1. The goal of ImgRecon is to make different algorithms used in forward & backward models of medical images readily available. 
2. Then one can use these algorithms in a plug-n-play manner in accordance to his/her need. 
3. List of these algorithms that we plan to provide through this platform is shown in a schematic below
