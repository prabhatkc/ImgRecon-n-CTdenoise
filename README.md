## ct-recon ##

1. The objective of **ct-recon** is to make different algorithms used in forward & inverse processes of medical images readily available. 
2. Then one make use of these algorithms in a plug-n-play manner in accordance to his/her need/application. 
4. Finally, one can use (traditional and new) error analyses techniques provided here. 
3. List of these algorithms that we (seek to) provide through this platform is shown in a schematic below:
